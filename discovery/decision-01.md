Problem
How should planners allocate scarce cores today, knowing tomorrow’s high-priority order may need the same core?

Beliefs
What must be true for this to be a good idea?

Measures
What would I observe if those beliefs are true?

Actions
What small thing can I do to check?

Decision
What will I decide based on the result?
